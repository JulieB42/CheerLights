# CheerLights
CheerLights that will allow anyone to update a color from a web page.
The Arduino code is good for an ESP3266 or ESP32. Just comment/uncomment what you need.
The web code is Active Server Pages with a SQL Server database to store the current color on the web site.

Please note that I've stripped out the connection strings and other items that may be private like wi-fi credentials. You'll want to replace those with your own info.
